### Block Chain Fundamentals
We won't cover this material until later or never
* Hash Chain
* Forks
* Longest Chain
* Proof of Work

### Rholang 1
* Send and Receive
* Quoting and unquoting with `@` and `*`
* `new` names
* Strings

### Rholang 2
* Pattern matching
* Bundles
* Data structures
* Recursion
* **Project:** Implement makeMint-style token

### Rholang 3
* Advanced pattern matching
* **Project:** Implement merge sort or some other similarly interesting algorithm

### RNode Basics
* Install and run RNode
* Use thin clients
* deploy and propose blocks

### Validating

* Practice of bootstrapping own network
* Key management best practices
* Ecomonics

### Casper 1
* Proof of Stake and wagering to play
* Validator weights
* Justifications
* Fork choice rule
* Equivocations

### Casper 2
