    <h1>The RChain Platform</h1>
    <h3>Blockchain that's scalable, efficient, dependable, and truly decentralized</h3>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p>RChain is a complete blockchain platform for distributed applications. Intelligent, concurrent execution throughout the network unlocks blockchain's potential for transactions of every type and scale. Designed for maximum efficiency at minimal computational and environmental cost, RChain provides the foundation and utility for global coordination.</p>

            <h2>CURRENT STATE</h2>
            <p>Today's blockchains have fallen short.</p>
            <p>Current systems are constrained by the single chain problem. Sequential computing inevitably limits scalability and speed, while increases transaction costs. Massive energy and computational requirements have left the promise of decentralized mass adoption unrealized.</p>

            <p>Innovations in consensus and concurrent processing increase transaction velocity, security, scalability, and sustainability.</p>
            <p>Unlike other chains, RChain's concurrent computing capabilities exist natively in the architecture.</p>

        <h3>RHO</h3>
        <h2>Reflective Higher Order Computing</h2>
        <p>Reflective Higher Order Calculus (Rho Calculus) is the breakthrough computing model that powers RChain. Rho powers RChain’s unmatched efficiency at scale and makes it possible for developers to build safer dApps, faster.</p>

        <div class="flexWrapper">
            <p>Namespaces, virtual groups of Rnodes within the Rchain network, can be customized by developers for specific parameters.</p>
            <p>Namespaces act as virtual <i>channels</i> on the network, independently and concurrently processing transactions.</p>
            <p>Next-generation sharding divides the network into optimized pieces, solving for the racing condition found in other chains.</p>
            <p>Developers are empowered to determine how contracts will be executed and optimzed for application-specific requirements.</p>

            <p>Built-in privacy protocols ensure security and data resilience.</p>
            <p>Write code rapidly and confidently, knowing code and contracts must be correct by construction.</p>
            <p>Fine-grained concurrency enables developers to choose an optimal, right-sized validation path for every transaction.</p>
